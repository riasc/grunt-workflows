# Grunt-Workflows
This is a collection of grunt-workflows that make development easier.

## Usage
`npm init` creates a `package.json` that is used by npm to track the dependencies. Likewise, `package.json` can then later
be used to install all the dependencies through `npm install`. It is important to note that the `name` attribute in the
`package.json` has to be different from the name of any package that should be installed.
